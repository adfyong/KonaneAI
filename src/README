NAME
	Agent - an intelligent agent that plays the game of Konane

SYNOPSIS
	Agent [FILE] [W or B]

DESCRIPTION
	The Agent executable is an intelligent agent used to play the game of Konane.
	It takes a file that contains the initial board state and either a 'W' or a 'B'
	to indicate whether it is playing as White or Black, respectively.  The game
	is meant to be played with a driver by default but if the user compiles with
	the -DPRETTY flag then the game will output the board state and will prompt the
	user for a move.

COMPILATION
	To compile just enter enter make inside the directory of the source files.
	The compile flags that are supported are as follows:

	    DEBUG_GAMEOVER - information about when a gameover state has been reached
	    DEBUG_HEUR	   - used to debug the heuristic, will output moveable white pieces
	    		     vs. moveable black
            DEBUG_HEUR_2   - more details about the heuristic
	    SKIP_AB 	   - skip the alpha-beta search algorithm, only useful if you add
	    		     your own debug code before or after
            DEBUG	   - prints detailed information at each node in the search
	    PRETTY 	   - recompile with this if you do not have a driver to port
	    		     moves to and from the agent and want to play the agent
			     yourself... Good luck :)


	If you want to change the time the Agent takes to "think" between it's moves,
	which in turn will increase the depth to which the search can go,there is a
	#define called THINKING_TIME that accepts an integer value that represents the
	time, in seconds, the agent is allowed to take between each move.
